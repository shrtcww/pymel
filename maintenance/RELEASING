Building an Official PyMEL Release
==================================

Before proceeding, install the necessary third party modules

  - setuptools and easy_install. from the base pymel directory:

./maintenance/install_dependencies.sh $MAYA_LOCATION


1) Build cache(s)
-----------------

  - make sure environment is clean (default user prefs, etc) except
    possibly for adding custom pymel into path...

  - delete existing cache for version you wish to rebuild
    start GUI version of maya you wish to rebuild
    in script editor, run following, substituting location of your dev
    version of pymel::
      
import sys
pymelPath = r'C:\Dev\Projects\eclipse\workspace\pymelProject\pymel'   # ...or wherever YOUR pymel version is installed
if sys.path[0] != pymelPath:
    sys.path.insert(0, pymelPath)
import pymel.core as pm
          
  - building of api cache loads plugins, then building of cmd cache
    unloads them... unfortunately, some of the built in plugins may not
    unload cleanly, resulting in an error; therefore, may be necessary
    to run the above steps twice (once to build api cache, once for
    cmd cache) 

2) Run tests
------------

  - cd into tests directory, then on WINDOWS run:

        ./pymel_test.py

    OR, if on linux/mac:

        ./pymel_test_output.bash


3) build stubs
--------------

  - from a clean/default environment maya gui, run:

import maintenance.stubs
reload(maintenance.stubs)
maintenance.stubs.pymelstubs()

  - test stubs - ie, from shell in the pymel directory, do::
     
python -c "import maintenance.stubs; maintenance.stubs.stubstest('./extras/completion/py')"


4) changelog
------------

  - run changelog script in this folder::

        changelog $PREVIOUS_PYMEL_VERSION $CURRENT_REVISION

  - copy results from resulting maintenance/CHANGELOG file to CHANGELOG.rst
    edit as necessary


5) build docs 
-------------

  - from a clean/default environment maya gui *without pymel imported*, run:

import maintenance.docs as docs
docs.generate()
docs.build()


6) run makerelease
------------------

./maintenance/makerelease $PYMEL_VERSION
